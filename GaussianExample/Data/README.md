## Files
### data_exact.py
generate exact Green's function data from $A(\omega)$.

### weights.py
seed a number of random weights $w_i$ such that $\sum_{i} w_i = 1$. This is to insure the physical condition that 
$$ \int A(\omega) \, d\omega = 1 $$

### data_guassian.py
calculate Green's function from spectral function which is a sum of independent Gaussian wave packets.
